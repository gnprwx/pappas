## Refactoring

After dedicating a substantial amount of time to working with React over the last month and a half, I decided to refactor my project, [audioo](https://audioo.org). Originally built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site is now optimized and performant due to using tools such as React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and React Howler. The refactoring was notably smoother compared to the site's initial creation, which, looking back, had a codebase that wasn't particularly elegant. However, understanding and acknowledging that signifies my growth and learning as a developer. Without making and experiencing that initial build, I wouldn't have been able to rebuild it the way I had.

## Tailwind

About a month ago, I stumbled upon Tailwind by chance. The documentation was incredibly straightforward, allowing me to integrate it into a project in 15 minutes. After tinkering with its syntax, I was ready to write all the styling in Tailwind. I think my ease in picking it up stemmed from my extensive experience with CSS, as I've likely spent more time on CSS files than any other file type. It's surprisingly easy to get absorbed in CSS. You endlessly make adjustments and check for changes. I had one project where I spent countless hours in a massive CSS file, which totaled around 1,000 lines.

However, this investment paid off with Tailwind. I can swiftly create a prototyped React site with Tailwind. The speed at which I can work with it is mind-boggling compared to my previous methodsâ€”using HTML, CSS, and JS. Even employing React with CSS pales in comparison. It's astonishing to realize how much more efficient I've become as a developer by simply using different tools. Tailwind is the perfect example of such a tool.

PS: I plan on replacing the CSS on this site with Tailwind soon.

## Ethical Hacking

In my web development bootcamp, we've briefly touched on the concept of writing code defensively. While learning to write servers, API routes, and SQL queries, I discovered that specific query structures could leave the system vulnerable to SQL injections. This prompted me to delve deeper into security measures for web apps. That's where the concept of ethical hacking entered the picture.

I've recently dedicated a portion of my time to researching this area and found that protecting sites from hackers isn't always given the priority it deserves. So, I resolved to gain knowledge in ethical hacking, focusing on hardening websites against potential attacks. Fortunately, there's a decent selection of books on ethical hacking, and while many cover a broader scope beyond websites, they still touch on it to a considerable extent.

My journey into learning ethical hacking begins with the book [Ethical Hacking](https://nostarch.com/ethical-hacking): A Hands-on Introduction to Breaking In. I've recently set up my virtual lab to practice hacking on self-created machines, and I'm looking forward to the results I garner from the lab practices. It's not just about defending my machines and websites but acquiring skills to apply across various projects in the professional realm.

My aim is twofold: I want to establish myself as a proficient web developer with diverse skills and someone who's trusted to write robust, fortified code that safeguards web apps and their data from potential breaches.
