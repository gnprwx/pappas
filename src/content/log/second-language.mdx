Learning a second programming language is quite an involved process, as there are a few factors to consider.

1. What is the job market like for the chosen language?
2. What is the complexity of that language?
3. What is that level of complexity based on the language I'm using now?
4. Is now the right time to invest in it if it's far more complex than the language I know?
5. Is now the right time to look into a second language?

From what I understand, I should be competent in my first programming language well enough to think of an idea, map it out, and then program it efficiently. That sounds like a dream to me and something I'm looking forward to in the future.

At the same time, I am fascinated by other languages as well. So many languages have different intriguing strengths, and learning another language in my spare time is appealing. The truth is that I have to be smart about it because the goal is to leverage it in this highly competitive environment. I can't fully indulge in my choices. Not yet. I have a lot to learn.

The languages I'm most interested in are complex, old, or will require more time than I can fiscally spare. And that's OK. I will get to them eventually. Right now, I need to focus on understanding what the particular programming language is suited for, the learning curve based on my knowledge, the benefits of writing in it, and what opportunities it grants. A part of what it can also do is bridge to other languages, which can further bridge to other languages with increasing complexity. That is the path I've decided upon: a transition gradual enough that the complexity translates into having fun learning something new instead of being an obstacle!

Knowing many different languages offers flexibility in the career market, and fortunately, they share similar tools. But a critical look will show that some languages are excellent at doing things efficiently, while some utilize simpler syntax to produce quick results. All are very important, but so is knowing the climate of where languages stand in the professional world. To me, this is the hardest part to decode.

To conclude my digressions, I intend to fully utilize my first programming language while engaging with an in-demand language that can take a reasonable amount of time to learn based on my current proficiency.
